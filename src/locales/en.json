It is a set of components that allow supervisors to assign practical programming problems to students through a web interface. After solving each problem, students upload their solution to the system and ReCodEx automaticaly evaluates it (typically checking the correctness of program output) and assigns an appropriate number of points. Students have quick feedback about their solution and supervisors do not have to manually check each solution for basic correctness (like that the program compiles and gives correct results in a reasonable amount of time).",
