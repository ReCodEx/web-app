It is a set of components, which allows assigning practical programming problems to students by their supervisors through web interface. After solving the problem students upload their solution to the system and ReCodEx automatically evaluates them (typically checking correctness of program output) and assigns corresponding amount of points. Students have quick feedback about their solution and supervisors does not have to manually check each solution for basic correctness (like that the program compiles and gives correct results in reasonable time).",
